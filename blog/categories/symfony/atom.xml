    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever worked with Entity Managers, Repositories or Factories in Symfony?
Yes, for sure you&rsquo;ve done that. Indeed, if you work with entities in your
project, these type of objects will be your daily, so we want to introduce you a
new concept, born in <a href="http://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">Elcodi project</a> and
created in order to simplify the management of an entity inside a service,
fixture or functional test.</p>

<p>Please, welcome the Director class.</p>

<h3>Director</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a service called <code>CartWrapper</code>. This service is meant to be a
wrapper of a cart, and its behavior is that easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you require an existing user&rsquo;s cart, retrieve it from database and return
it</li>
<li>Otherwise, create a new Cart, save it and return it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see a small implementation of such service.</p>

<p>``` php
/<em>*
 * CartWrapper
 </em>/
class cartWrapper
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var EntityManager
 *
 * Cart entity manager
 */
protected $entityManager;

/**
 * @var CartFactory
 *
 * Cart factory
 */
protected $cartFactory;

/**
 * @var CartRepository
 *
 * Cart repository
 */
protected $cartRepository;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param EntityManager  $entityManager  Entity manager
 * @param CartFactory    $cartFactory    Cart factory
 * @param CartRepository $cartRepository Cart repository
 */
public function __construct(
    EntityManager $entityManager,
    CartFactory $cartFactory,
    CartRepository $cartRepository
)
{
    $this-&gt;entityManager = $entityManager;
    $this-&gt;cartFactory = $cartFactory;
    $this-&gt;cartRepository = $cartRepository;
}

/**
 * Load cart
 *
 * @param UserInterface $user User
 *
 * @return CartInterface
 */
public function loadCart($user)
{
    $userCart = $this
        -&gt;cartRepository
        -&gt;findOneBy([
            'user' =&gt; $user
        ]);

    if (!($userCart instanceof CartInterface)) {

        $newCart = $this
            -&gt;cartFactory
            -&gt;create($user);

        $this
            -&gt;entityManager
            -&gt;persist($newCart);

        $this
            -&gt;entityManager
            -&gt;flush($newCart);

        $userCart = $newCart;
    }

    return $userCart;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>As you can see, this services needs 3 dependencies, and would be difficult to
reduce this number in order to reduce the complexity if the class. This service
is intended to do one single thing.</p>

<p>What is the strategy here? Do you know what the <em>Facade pattern</em> is, right?
Well, the way for solving this amount of classes is creating a new facade called
Director, intended to provide a small set of usable methods simplifying the
management of the entities.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see the implementation of this class. You can find the real implementation
in <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">elcodi/core</a>.</p>

<p>``` php
namespace Elcodi\Component\Core\Services;</p>

<p>use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository;
use UnexpectedValueException;</p>

<p>use Elcodi\Component\Core\Factory\Abstracts\AbstractFactory;</p>

<p>/<em>*
 * Class ObjectDirector
 *
 * This object is a facade for these different persistence-related elements
 *
 * * Object Manager
 * * Repository
 * * Factory
 *
 * Allows final user to manage in a simple way an entity or a set of entities.
 * Provides a reduced (but useful) set of methods.
 </em>/
class ObjectDirector
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var ObjectManager
 *
 * Manager
 */
protected $manager;

/**
 * @var ObjectRepository
 *
 * Repository
 */
protected $repository;

/**
 * @var AbstractFactory
 *
 * Factory
 */
protected $factory;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param ObjectManager    $manager    Manager
 * @param ObjectRepository $repository Repository
 * @param AbstractFactory  $factory    Factory
 */
public function __construct(
    ObjectManager $manager,
    ObjectRepository $repository,
    AbstractFactory $factory
) {
    $this-&gt;manager = $manager;
    $this-&gt;repository = $repository;
    $this-&gt;factory = $factory;
}

/**

public function find($id)
{
    return $this

        -&gt;find($id);
}

/**

public function findBy(

    $offset = null)
{
    return $this
        -&gt;repository

        );
}

/**

public function findOneBy(array $criteria)
{
    return $this
        -&gt;repository
        -&gt;findOneBy(
            $criteria
        );
}

public function save($data)
{
    if (is_array($data)) {
        foreach ($data as $entity) {
            $this
                -&gt;manager
                -&gt;persist($entity);

    return $data;

public function remove($data)

        foreach ($data as $entity) {
            $this
                -&gt;manager
                -&gt;remove($entity);
        }
    } else {
        $this
            -&gt;manager

    $this
        -&gt;manager
        -&gt;flush($data);

    return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This implementation provides us a simple set of actions for our entities (maybe
the most used).</p>

<ul>
<li>find(&hellip;)</li>
<li>findAll()</li>
<li>findBy(&hellip;)</li>
<li>findOneBy(&hellip;)</li>
<li>create()</li>
<li>save()</li>
<li>remove()</li>
</ul>


<p>This implementation is so useful for many scenarios, but in our case what we
found is that using Directors, our tests are reduced in many ways (less lines of
code, less complexity, more effectiveness), and the fixtures are totally
improved, focusing on the most important thing: our business logic.</p>

<h3>Directors as a service</h3>

<p>To use a Director as a service you need to define your repository as a service
as well, assuming that your factory is already a service called <code>cart_factory</code>
and assuming as well that we will work with the default entity manager
<code>doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager</code> (not a good practice, but let&rsquo;s suppose it
is in this example).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how to define your repository as a service.</p>

<p>``` yml
services:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Doctrine Repository
#
cart_repository:
    class: Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository
    factory:
        - @elcodi.provider.repository
        - getRepositoryByEntityNamespace
    arguments:
        - My\Cart\Namespace
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You will find the service <code>elcodi.provider.repository</code> inside the Bundle
<code>elcodi/core-bundle</code>. This bundle is not coupled to any Elcodi functionality so
you can use it in your own projects as a set of isolated features.</p>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s create the Director definition by using the factory pattern.</p>

<p>``` yml
services:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Directors
#
elcodi.director.cart:
    class: Elcodi\Component\Core\Services\ObjectDirector
    arguments:
        - @doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager
        - @cart_repository
        - @cart_factory
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Take in account that each entity will have it&rsquo;s own Director instance, so this
is why we use the factory pattern here.</p>

<p>How can we use the new Director service in our first <code>CartWrapper</code>
implementation by changing and improving the services dependencies? Let&rsquo;s do
that!</p>

<p>``` php
/<em>*
 * CartWrapper
 </em>/
class cartWrapper
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var ObjectDirector
 *
 * Cart director
 */
protected $cartDirector;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param ObjectDirector $cartDirector Cart Director
 */
public function __construct(ObjectDirector $cartDirector)
{
    $this-&gt;cartDirector = $cartDirector;
}

/**
 * Load cart
 *
 * @param UserInterface $user User
 *
 * @return CartInterface
 */
public function loadCart($user)
{
    $userCart = $this
        -&gt;cartDirector
        -&gt;findOneBy([
            'user' =&gt; $user
        ]);

    if (!($userCart instanceof CartInterface)) {

        $newCart = $this
            -&gt;cartDirector
            -&gt;create($user);

        $this
            -&gt;cartDirector
            -&gt;save($newCart);

        $userCart = $newCart;
    }

    return $userCart;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">Elcodi</a> is fully based on the usage of
Directors. This does <strong>not</strong> mean that we must use Directors everywhere.
Sometimes you need to use only one of the wrapped objects, and in that case you
must inject them one by one, so please, before using this new object think about
it, think about the pros and the contras and be responsible about your
implementation.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to comment about what do you think about this feature.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2015/04/04/first-stable-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there everyone.</p>

<p>The Elcodi core team is glad to announce that next June 1st, we will tag the
first stable release of the project (Elcodi will be still based on Symfony, you
know how much we like Symfony and its community&hellip;)</p>

<h3>Elcodi v1.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>Until this day, we&rsquo;ll finish stabilization of all packages</li>
<li>We will work so hard to finish a documentation for all of you</li>
<li>All available features will be covered by unit, functional and behavioral
tests, using PHPUnit and Behat 3.0</li>
<li>After <code>v1.0</code> we will start working on <code>v3.0</code>. This new version will be
released next November in order to be compatible with Symfony <code>v3.*</code>. It means
as well that this new version will introduce some BC Break, of course.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, we have less than 2 months to stabilize Elcodi package, and we need your
help.</p>

<p>Some days ago, we announced the
<a href="http://blog.elcodi.io/blog/2015/03/03/elcodi-bug-hunting/">Elcodi Bug Hunting</a>,
remember? Well, initially this contest was during this past March, but we have
decided to enlarge the period of the contest until June 1st, the day of the
release.</p>

<p>Until now, we have received some help from some people. Special thanks for them.</p>

    <link href="http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-28T11:42:47+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might say that we&rsquo;ve evolved.</p>

<p>An evolution ought to be seen as a positive thing, and ours is no exception.
At first, we had serious doubts about the nature of our project. One of the
questions we kept asking ourselves was what factors should we consider in
choosing whether and when to engage external projects or libraries, and we
believe we made the right decision. In fact, that decision brought us forward in
a big way toward defining ourselves.</p>

<p>Flexible e-commerce components for Symfony2</p>

<p>Anyway, this phrase is actually very ambiguous, as we could be referring to
Symfony as a set of PHP components or as the Framework (I&rsquo;ve always wondered
why they have the same name&hellip; it causes a lot of confusion).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we wanted to reflect a bit, starting from the code itself. Do we want
to use the Symfony Framework or the Symfony Components? The answer seemed to
emerge spontaneously. We want to work with the Symfony components, but we also
want to propose bundles that use the framework.</p>

<p>This was the origin of this commit.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239">https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239</a></p>

<p>We have only just planted the seed with this refactoring. We have realized, even
more, the importance of having both functional testing and unit testing (unit
tests are almost all for the components, while functional tests are for the
bundles). This needs more work, but at least we have lifted this project to a
level at which we truly feel comfortable. It&rsquo;s an excellent starting point for
a long and exciting path ahead.</p>

<p>This change has resulted in some collateral damage, as it has changed the path
of our bundles, meaning that the &ldquo;subtree split&rdquo; has resulted in totally new
repositories beginning with the first commit after refactoring. This means that
all tags prior to version 0.3.0 have been lost, so we apologize to those who
have started to tinkle with our new bundles. You&rsquo;ll now need to adapt to version
~0.3 and check that everything&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>We are available for any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

<p>As a final point for what we shared in previous posts, the last but definitely not least element to consider is the <em>team</em>.</p>

<p>Such an ambitious venture needs a committed and visionary crew, and obviously more <em>heads</em> and <em>hands</em>. This is why we are opening job positions for a couple of skilled software artisans willing to join the journey with us. We will soon post the complete description. The company is located in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>We are looking for passionate and inspired artisans that love to craft products to be used by fellow developers and that believe in the potential of a community that grows around an <em>opensource</em> project.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>The final word is a big <strong>thank you</strong> to all the people that have been supporting us &ndash; by contributing in different forms &ndash; and to whom will do it someday.</p>

<p>We really seek to build something useful for the community and to receive the necessary feedback and support in order to speed up the development and deliver the sound, reliable, flexible product that we have in mind.</p>

<p>As for now, the Elcodi team hopes that you&rsquo;ll get involved with the project and wishes you a great summer break.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

</ul>


<p>In the folowing weeks we would like to get to a first community stable version. Though last week we placed the initial milestone it is important to define a release plan for the following steps.</p>

<p>We set up a list of <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/milestones">milestones</a> to show a proposed roadmap:</p>

<p>```
Version 0.3</p>

<pre><code>- Closed 8 days ago
- 100% complete  0 open  11 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.4</p>

<pre><code>- Due by August 15, 2014
- 0% complete  0 open  0 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.5</p>

<pre><code>- Due by August 29, 2014
- 17% complete  5 open  1 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.6</p>

<pre><code>- Due by September 11, 2014
- 0% complete  2 open  0 closed
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This means we will be working on fine-tune our general roadmap and on fixing and refining what we have &ndash; no new features will be developed until we improve stability &ndash; in the hope of clearing things up a bit for developers interested in working with Elcodi foundations.</p>

<p>At this stage, it is possible for new commits to introduce <em>BC breaks</em>. There is an open <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/issues/34">issue</a> regarding <code>@api</code> tagging in phpdoc but as suggests in the discussion it is not really needed in the absence of a frozen stable release.</p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t be following strict <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> until we reach a stable release, though we are using <em>patch version</em> for small fixes that do not cause incompatibilities and <em>minor version</em> for changes that <em>could</em> cause BC.</p>

<p>Of course this will change once we approach <code>v1.0</code>, when we will <code>@api</code> freeze core components and enforce full semantic versioning.</p>

<p>Reaching the <code>stable</code> version also means we will release the <em>Market</em>, so that plugins and components can be developed with no fears of major version breaks.</p>

<p>We are on our way there, things look good!</p>
