    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&hellip; and we did it.</p>

<p>It is something really amazing. We&rsquo;ve finally reached our first Beta stage.
After more than 1 year of hard and non-stop work, we have tagged our first beta
version in order to provide some stability to all Elcodi installations.</p>

<h2>What means Beta</h2>

<p>If you read some literature about software versions, you&rsquo;ll find that there is
always a set of pre-defined steps based on the stability of the project</p>

<ul>
<li>v1.0.0-alpha1: Hey developer! We&rsquo;re building it but we&rsquo;re not ready to be used
in production. Possible big BC breaks, incremental set of features and less
communication. Careful!</li>
<li>v1.0.0-beta1: Hey developer! Well, we think that we&rsquo;re done. We think that
we&rsquo;re done with features so we aim to stabilize the version. Testing and
documentation is part of the development here. C'mon!</li>
<li>v1.0.0-RC1: Hey developer! Tested enough, so&hellip; how about make this package
stable? Lets purpose a set of BC promises and let&rsquo;s make possible the usage of
<code>^1.0</code> in composer.</li>
<li>v1.0.0: Hey everyone! We&rsquo;re here! This package is stable. We think that we&rsquo;ve
no many issues here, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to using us in your projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, some people or projects will understand these steps in a different
way, but in Elcodi, this is the idea.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>For the last months, we have been focused on developing.</p>

<ul>
<li>elcodi/elcodi

<ul>
<li>1.616 commits</li>
<li>239 Issues closed</li>
<li>586 PR accepted</li>
<li>21 Contributors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>elcodi/bamboo

<ul>
<li>1.763 commits</li>
<li>49 Issues closed</li>
<li>450 PR accepted</li>
<li>21 Contributors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, developing have been our priority and we&rsquo;ve lost the opportunity of
showing the world our great work. Our communication has been poor and
insufficient because of our lack of time. And we know that this aspect of the
project need to change.</p>

<p>Since today, we&rsquo;ll return with our &ldquo;A week of Elcodi&rdquo;. Each week we will
document all our work. Each project using Elcodi will have a lot of feedback.
Each change affecting the BC compatibility will be announced in a properly way
and since today, we will take care about all projects by creating and promoting
our own community events and User Groups around the world.</p>

<p>Remember all the core team is in <a href="https://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi">Gitter</a> so if
you have doubts and you want to talk about any aspect of the project, don&rsquo;t
hesitate to talk with us :)</p>

<h2>Reaching RC</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re done with features. We have developed a nice Plugin infrastructure that
will be documented as soon as possible, in order to externalize all extra
implementations. Our maximum priority right now is to finish what we begin
one year ago.</p>

<p>The project is pretty stable, being used in some projects in production, selling
and working properly. For example <a href="http://deliberry.com">deliberry.com</a>, a
company based in Barcelona that is actually growing day by day, based in Elcodi.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re proud!</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ll have soon a great directory with projects based on Elcodi, so if your
company is Elcodi based, please, show us your case :)</p></blockquote>

<p>So, for the next 2 months, we will support all projects based on Elcodi, with
a big testing layer with more Unit, Functional, Behavioral and Response testing.</p>

<p>We will add tons of documentation showing how to do every single thing inside
the Elcodi world and finally, as soon Elcodi is stable enough, then we will
tag the first RC version.</p>

<h2>Test us!</h2>

<p>We are Open Source, and supporting us will never mean paying us. Elcodi is free
because is born from and for the community, so the best way to promote Elcodi is
talking about it.</p>

<p>Elcodi is not only E-commerce and Symfony, is about developing, sharing,
enjoying and improving. Each member of the community is important and we will
demonstrate this not only with words but with a strong layer of support.</p>

<p>As soon as the community will grow, we will lead the creation of user groups
around the world. We will show how we work and what using Elcodi is not only an
experience but a way of understanding the E-commerce development.</p>

<p><a href="http://elcodi.io/docs/quick-start/">Test us now</a> and share your thoughts, your
non-valuable feedback, or <a href="https://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi">just say hello</a> :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone.</p>

<p>This is a call to the multi language fairy. Our project is still learning some
new and nice languages. Bamboo talks English, Spanish, Catalan and some French,
but we want to be a project for everyone in this world, no matter where you
live, no matter what you talk.</p>

<p>We are looking for some contributors to maintain some other interesting
translations. Indeed, all of them!</p>

<ul>
<li>Euskal</li>
<li>Galego</li>
<li>Deutsch</li>
<li>Italiano</li>
<li>Português</li>
<li>Nederlands</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>We are looking for smaller translations, for those shops that want to provide
specific and local languages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Irish</li>
<li>Andalúz</li>
<li>Sardu</li>
<li>Esperanto</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally we are looking for some popular and fictitious languages. We want to be
for everyone, remember?</p>

<ul>
<li>Klingon</li>
<li>Elvish</li>
<li>Dwarf language</li>
<li>Lorem Ipsum</li>
<li>Random language</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have any interest in translate the application here, please tell us
something nice <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo/issues/450">here</a> or keep in
touch with us at <a href="http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi">gitter</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy your week :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an official statement from Elcodi Team.</p>

<blockquote><p>This post was an April Fools joke. Elcodi will be based on Symfony for a long
time. We love Symfony.</p></blockquote>

<p>After some nice months using Symfony in our project Elcodi, and after many
reflections on how to increase the project quality, we&rsquo;re proud to announce that
we are moving to Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Until version <code>v0.6.*</code> we will continue evolving our code for these people who
is nowadays using Elcodi in their projects, but after that, we will move all
our code to Ruby.</p>

    <link href="http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-28T11:42:47+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might say that we&rsquo;ve evolved.</p>

<p>An evolution ought to be seen as a positive thing, and ours is no exception.
At first, we had serious doubts about the nature of our project. One of the
questions we kept asking ourselves was what factors should we consider in
choosing whether and when to engage external projects or libraries, and we
believe we made the right decision. In fact, that decision brought us forward in
a big way toward defining ourselves.</p>

<p>Flexible e-commerce components for Symfony2</p>

<p>Anyway, this phrase is actually very ambiguous, as we could be referring to
Symfony as a set of PHP components or as the Framework (I&rsquo;ve always wondered
why they have the same name&hellip; it causes a lot of confusion).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we wanted to reflect a bit, starting from the code itself. Do we want
to use the Symfony Framework or the Symfony Components? The answer seemed to
emerge spontaneously. We want to work with the Symfony components, but we also
want to propose bundles that use the framework.</p>

<p>This was the origin of this commit.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239">https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239</a></p>

<p>We have only just planted the seed with this refactoring. We have realized, even
more, the importance of having both functional testing and unit testing (unit
tests are almost all for the components, while functional tests are for the
bundles). This needs more work, but at least we have lifted this project to a
level at which we truly feel comfortable. It&rsquo;s an excellent starting point for
a long and exciting path ahead.</p>

<p>This change has resulted in some collateral damage, as it has changed the path
of our bundles, meaning that the &ldquo;subtree split&rdquo; has resulted in totally new
repositories beginning with the first commit after refactoring. This means that
all tags prior to version 0.3.0 have been lost, so we apologize to those who
have started to tinkle with our new bundles. You&rsquo;ll now need to adapt to version
~0.3 and check that everything&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>We are available for any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
