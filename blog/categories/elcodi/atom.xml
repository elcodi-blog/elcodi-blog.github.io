    <link href="http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-28T11:42:47+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/28/we-have-evolved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might say that we&rsquo;ve evolved.</p>

<p>An evolution ought to be seen as a positive thing, and ours is no exception.
At first, we had serious doubts about the nature of our project. One of the
questions we kept asking ourselves was what factors should we consider in
choosing whether and when to engage external projects or libraries, and we
believe we made the right decision. In fact, that decision brought us forward in
a big way toward defining ourselves.</p>

<p>Flexible e-commerce components for Symfony2</p>

<p>Anyway, this phrase is actually very ambiguous, as we could be referring to
Symfony as a set of PHP components or as the Framework (I&rsquo;ve always wondered
why they have the same name&hellip; it causes a lot of confusion).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we wanted to reflect a bit, starting from the code itself. Do we want
to use the Symfony Framework or the Symfony Components? The answer seemed to
emerge spontaneously. We want to work with the Symfony components, but we also
want to propose bundles that use the framework.</p>

<p>This was the origin of this commit.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239">https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239</a></p>

<p>We have only just planted the seed with this refactoring. We have realized, even
more, the importance of having both functional testing and unit testing (unit
tests are almost all for the components, while functional tests are for the
bundles). This needs more work, but at least we have lifted this project to a
level at which we truly feel comfortable. It&rsquo;s an excellent starting point for
a long and exciting path ahead.</p>

<p>This change has resulted in some collateral damage, as it has changed the path
of our bundles, meaning that the &ldquo;subtree split&rdquo; has resulted in totally new
repositories beginning with the first commit after refactoring. This means that
all tags prior to version 0.3.0 have been lost, so we apologize to those who
have started to tinkle with our new bundles. You&rsquo;ll now need to adapt to version
~0.3 and check that everything&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>We are available for any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2014/08/11/a-short-break-for-meditation/">A short break for meditation</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/2014/08/12/our-roadmap/">Our roadmap</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2014/08/13/our-goals/">Our goals</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As a final point for what we shared in previous posts, the last but definitely not least element to consider is the <em>team</em>.</p>

<p>Such an ambitious venture needs a committed and visionary crew, and obviously more <em>heads</em> and <em>hands</em>. This is why we are opening job positions for a couple of skilled software artisans willing to join the journey with us. We will soon post the complete description. The company is located in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>We are looking for passionate and inspired artisans that love to craft products to be used by fellow developers and that believe in the potential of a community that grows around an <em>opensource</em> project.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>The final word is a big <strong>thank you</strong> to all the people that have been supporting us &ndash; by contributing in different forms &ndash; and to whom will do it someday.</p>

<p>We really seek to build something useful for the community and to receive the necessary feedback and support in order to speed up the development and deliver the sound, reliable, flexible product that we have in mind.</p>

<p>As for now, the Elcodi team hopes that you&rsquo;ll get involved with the project and wishes you a great summer break.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

</ul>


<p>In the folowing weeks we would like to get to a first community stable version. Though last week we placed the initial milestone it is important to define a release plan for the following steps.</p>

<p>We set up a list of <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/milestones">milestones</a> to show a proposed roadmap:</p>

<p>```
Version 0.3</p>

<pre><code>- Closed 8 days ago
- 100% complete  0 open  11 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.4</p>

<pre><code>- Due by August 15, 2014
- 0% complete  0 open  0 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.5</p>

<pre><code>- Due by August 29, 2014
- 17% complete  5 open  1 closed
</code></pre>

<p>Version 0.6</p>

<pre><code>- Due by September 11, 2014
- 0% complete  2 open  0 closed
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This means we will be working on fine-tune our general roadmap and on fixing and refining what we have &ndash; no new features will be developed until we improve stability &ndash; in the hope of clearing things up a bit for developers interested in working with Elcodi foundations.</p>

<p>At this stage, it is possible for new commits to introduce <em>BC breaks</em>. There is an open <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/issues/34">issue</a> regarding <code>@api</code> tagging in phpdoc but as suggests in the discussion it is not really needed in the absence of a frozen stable release.</p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t be following strict <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> until we reach a stable release, though we are using <em>patch version</em> for small fixes that do not cause incompatibilities and <em>minor version</em> for changes that <em>could</em> cause BC.</p>

<p>Of course this will change once we approach <code>v1.0</code>, when we will <code>@api</code> freeze core components and enforce full semantic versioning.</p>

<p>Reaching the <code>stable</code> version also means we will release the <em>Market</em>, so that plugins and components can be developed with no fears of major version breaks.</p>

<p>We are on our way there, things look good!</p>

    <link href="http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/12/playing-with-php-ng/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T18:02:14+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2014/08/12/playing-with-php-ng</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot going on on the PHP community after Zeev Suraski published an <a href="http://zsuraski.blogspot.com.br/2014/07/benchmarking-phpng.html">article</a> where he ventured on assembling a performance comparison between <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phpng">PHPNG</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm">hhvm</a>. Needles to say that the results are promising and the performace benefits of the soon-to-be next PHP major release look impressive.</p>

<p>For the sake of curiosity, we tried to run Elcodi <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store">frontend store</a> on PHPNG and see how a Symfony applicaction would fare.</p>

<p>The test was made on an Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized">c3.xlarge</a> EC2 instance (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html">HVM virtualization</a>) running <strong>Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS</strong></p>

<h2>Installing PHPNG</h2>

<p>There are several options available for installing PHPNG binaries.</p>

<p>The first way is of course to follow the ninja path and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/phpng">compile it on your own</a>. Mind you that compiling PHPNG on an Ubuntu 14.04 is a source of headaches, since it requires <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison 2.7</a> but <code>trusty</code> official repositories provide it at version <code>3.0.2</code>, so you&rsquo;ll need to manually download and build it.</p>

<p>The easiest way is of course to add an <code>apt</code> repository providing the package. For the sake of simpliciy we can stuck with apprentice path, katanas can wait for the next bad guy.</p>

<p>Luckily Zend prepared <a href="http://repos.zend.com/zend-server/early-access/phpng/">an apt repo</a> for the <code>amd64</code> arch:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<pre><code># Remember to run these commands as root, or use sudo
$ wget http://repos.zend.com/zend.key -O- 2&gt; /dev/null | apt-key add -
$ echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://repos.zend.com/zend-server/early-access/phpng/ trusty zend" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/phpng.list
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install php5
</code></pre>

<p><code>``
This wil also install</code>apache2.2<code>and</code>libapache2-mod-php5`.</p>

<p>In order for a Symfony application to work, we will have to add at least the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php">i18n</a> and the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqlnd.php">mysqlnd</a> extensions.
Elcodi will also need <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">imagemagik</a> as the default image resize adapter for the <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/MediaBundle">MediaBundle</a>. Since we will work with MySQL, we also need <code>mysql-server</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NO</strong> For this test, to speed up things a little, we also need <a href="https://github.com/krakjoe/apcu">APCu</a> since we will configure Doctrine <a href="http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/2.0.x/reference/caching.html#metadata-cache">metadata</a> <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html#configuration-overview">cache</a></p>

<p>Summing it up:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<pre><code># As root user:
$ apt-get install php5-intl php5-mysqlnd mysql-server imagemagik
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Before proceeding, we are making a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>we created an apache <code>VirtualHost</code> for <code>test.example.com</code>, or whatever domain we&rsquo;d like to use, in <code>/var/www/bamboo</code></li>
<li>/var/www/bamboo is <em>writable</em> for user www-data, which is the user running apache in ubuntu</li>
<li><a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">composer.phar</a> is available and in PATH</li>
</ul>


<p>Now we can install Elcodi front store as follows:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<pre><code># Run command as apache user, which in ubuntu is www-data
# We assume that /var/www/bamboo is *writable* for user www-data
$ cd /var/www/bamboo
$ git clone https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store.git .
$ composer.phar install -o --no-dev
# Follow parameters in app/config/parameters.yml to configure MySQL access
$ php app/console doctrine:database:create -e=prod
$ php app/console doctrine:schema:create
$ php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --fixtures=vendor/elcodi/bamboo-fixtures/
$ php app/console assets:install web &amp;&amp; php app/console assetic:dump -e=prod --no-debug
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
