    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&hellip; and we did it.</p>

<p>It is something really amazing. We&rsquo;ve finally reached our first Beta stage.
After more than 1 year of hard and non-stop work, we have tagged our first beta
version in order to provide some stability to all Elcodi installations.</p>

<h2>What means Beta</h2>

<p>If you read some literature about software versions, you&rsquo;ll find that there is
always a set of pre-defined steps based on the stability of the project</p>

<ul>
<li>v1.0.0-alpha1: Hey developer! We&rsquo;re building it but we&rsquo;re not ready to be used
in production. Possible big BC breaks, incremental set of features and less
communication. Careful!</li>
<li>v1.0.0-beta1: Hey developer! Well, we think that we&rsquo;re done. We think that
we&rsquo;re done with features so we aim to stabilize the version. Testing and
documentation is part of the development here. C'mon!</li>
<li>v1.0.0-RC1: Hey developer! Tested enough, so&hellip; how about make this package
stable? Lets purpose a set of BC promises and let&rsquo;s make possible the usage of
<code>^1.0</code> in composer.</li>
<li>v1.0.0: Hey everyone! We&rsquo;re here! This package is stable. We think that we&rsquo;ve
no many issues here, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to using us in your projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, some people or projects will understand these steps in a different
way, but in Elcodi, this is the idea.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>For the last months, we have been focused on developing.</p>

<ul>
<li>elcodi/elcodi

<ul>
<li>1.616 commits</li>
<li>239 Issues closed</li>
<li>586 PR accepted</li>
<li>21 Contributors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>elcodi/bamboo

<ul>
<li>1.763 commits</li>
<li>49 Issues closed</li>
<li>450 PR accepted</li>
<li>21 Contributors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, developing have been our priority and we&rsquo;ve lost the opportunity of
showing the world our great work. Our communication has been poor and
insufficient because of our lack of time. And we know that this aspect of the
project need to change.</p>

<p>Since today, we&rsquo;ll return with our &ldquo;A week of Elcodi&rdquo;. Each week we will
document all our work. Each project using Elcodi will have a lot of feedback.
Each change affecting the BC compatibility will be announced in a properly way
and since today, we will take care about all projects by creating and promoting
our own community events and User Groups around the world.</p>

<p>Remember all the core team is in <a href="https://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi">Gitter</a> so if
you have doubts and you want to talk about any aspect of the project, don&rsquo;t
hesitate to talk with us :)</p>

<p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/elcodi_dev">Twitter</a> to join us!</p>

<h2>Reaching RC</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re done with features. We have developed a nice Plugin infrastructure that
will be documented as soon as possible, in order to externalize all extra
implementations. Our maximum priority right now is to finish what we begin
one year ago.</p>

<p>The project is pretty stable, being used in some projects in production, selling
and working properly. For example <a href="http://deliberry.com">deliberry.com</a>, a
company based in Barcelona that is actually growing day by day, based in Elcodi.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re proud!</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ll have soon a great directory with projects based on Elcodi, so if your
company is Elcodi based, please, show us your case :)</p></blockquote>

<p>So, for the next 2 months, we will support all projects based on Elcodi, with
a big testing layer with more Unit, Functional, Behavioral and Response testing.</p>

<p>We will add tons of documentation showing how to do every single thing inside
the Elcodi world and finally, as soon Elcodi is stable enough, then we will
tag the first RC version.</p>

<h2>Test us!</h2>

<p>We are Open Source, and supporting us will never mean paying us. Elcodi is free
because is born from and for the community, so the best way to promote Elcodi is
talking about it.</p>

<p>Elcodi is not only E-commerce and Symfony, is about developing, sharing,
enjoying and improving. Each member of the community is important and we will
demonstrate this not only with words but with a strong layer of support.</p>

<p>As soon as the community will grow, we will lead the creation of user groups
around the world. We will show how we work and what using Elcodi is not only an
experience but a way of understanding the E-commerce development.</p>

<p><a href="http://elcodi.io/docs/quick-start/">Test us now</a> and share your thoughts, your
non-valuable feedback, or <a href="https://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi">just say hello</a> :)</p>

    <link href="http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2015/04/20/introducing-the-directors-in-symfony/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-20T12:36:03+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2015/04/20/introducing-the-directors-in-symfony</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever worked with Entity Managers, Repositories or Factories in Symfony?
Yes, for sure you&rsquo;ve done that. Indeed, if you work with entities in your
project, these type of objects will be your daily, so we want to introduce you a
new concept, born in <a href="http://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">Elcodi project</a> and
created in order to simplify the management of an entity inside a service,
fixture or functional test.</p>

<p>Please, welcome the Director class.</p>

<h3>Director</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a service called <code>CartWrapper</code>. This service is meant to be a
wrapper of a cart, and its behavior is that easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you require an existing user&rsquo;s cart, retrieve it from database and return
it</li>
<li>Otherwise, create a new Cart, save it and return it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see a small implementation of such service.</p>

<p>``` php
/<em>*
 * CartWrapper
 </em>/
class cartWrapper
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var EntityManager
 *
 * Cart entity manager
 */
protected $entityManager;

/**
 * @var CartFactory
 *
 * Cart factory
 */
protected $cartFactory;

/**
 * @var CartRepository
 *
 * Cart repository
 */
protected $cartRepository;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param EntityManager  $entityManager  Entity manager
 * @param CartFactory    $cartFactory    Cart factory
 * @param CartRepository $cartRepository Cart repository
 */
public function __construct(
    EntityManager $entityManager,
    CartFactory $cartFactory,
    CartRepository $cartRepository
)
{
    $this-&gt;entityManager = $entityManager;
    $this-&gt;cartFactory = $cartFactory;
    $this-&gt;cartRepository = $cartRepository;
}

/**
 * Load cart
 *
 * @param UserInterface $user User
 *
 * @return CartInterface
 */
public function loadCart($user)
{
    $userCart = $this
        -&gt;cartRepository
        -&gt;findOneBy([
            'user' =&gt; $user
        ]);

    if (!($userCart instanceof CartInterface)) {

        $newCart = $this
            -&gt;cartFactory
            -&gt;create($user);

        $this
            -&gt;entityManager
            -&gt;persist($newCart);

        $this
            -&gt;entityManager
            -&gt;flush($newCart);

        $userCart = $newCart;
    }

    return $userCart;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>As you can see, this services needs 3 dependencies, and would be difficult to
reduce this number in order to reduce the complexity of the class. This service
is intended to do one single thing.</p>

<p>What is the strategy here? Do you know what the <em>Facade pattern</em> is, right?
Well, the way for solving this amount of classes is creating a new facade called
Director, intended to provide a small set of usable methods simplifying the
management of the entities.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see the implementation of this class. You can find the real implementation
in <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">elcodi/core</a>.</p>

<p>``` php
namespace Elcodi\Component\Core\Services;</p>

<p>use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository;
use UnexpectedValueException;</p>

<p>use Elcodi\Component\Core\Factory\Abstracts\AbstractFactory;</p>

<p>/<em>*
 * Class ObjectDirector
 *
 * This object is a facade for these different persistence-related elements
 *
 * * Object Manager
 * * Repository
 * * Factory
 *
 * Allows final user to manage in a simple way an entity or a set of entities.
 * Provides a reduced (but useful) set of methods.
 </em>/
class ObjectDirector
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var ObjectManager
 *
 * Manager
 */
protected $manager;

/**
 * @var ObjectRepository
 *
 * Repository
 */
protected $repository;

/**
 * @var AbstractFactory

 * Factory
 */
protected $factory;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param ObjectManager    $manager    Manager
 * @param ObjectRepository $repository Repository
 * @param AbstractFactory  $factory    Factory

    ObjectManager $manager,
    ObjectRepository $repository,
    AbstractFactory $factory
) {
    $this-&gt;manager = $manager;
    $this-&gt;repository = $repository;
    $this-&gt;factory = $factory;
}

        -&gt;repository

        );
}

/**

        -&gt;repository
        -&gt;findOneBy(

}

public function save($data)

                -&gt;manager

                -&gt;remove($entity);
        }
    } else {

    return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This implementation provides us a simple set of actions for our entities (maybe
the most used).</p>

<ul>
<li>find(&hellip;)</li>
<li>findAll()</li>
<li>findBy(&hellip;)</li>
<li>findOneBy(&hellip;)</li>
<li>create()</li>
<li>save()</li>
<li>remove()</li>
</ul>


<p>This implementation is so useful for many scenarios, but in our case what we
found is that using Directors, our tests are reduced in many ways (less lines of
code, less complexity, more effectiveness), and the fixtures are totally
improved, focusing on the most important thing: our business logic.</p>

<h3>Directors as a service</h3>

<p>To use a Director as a service you need to define your repository as a service
as well, assuming that your factory is already a service called <code>cart_factory</code>
and assuming as well that we will work with the default entity manager
<code>doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager</code> (not a good practice, but let&rsquo;s suppose it
is in this example).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how to define your repository as a service.</p>

<p>``` yml
services:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Doctrine Repository
#
cart_repository:
    class: Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository
    factory:
        - @elcodi.provider.repository
        - getRepositoryByEntityNamespace
    arguments:
        - My\Cart\Namespace
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You will find the service <code>elcodi.provider.repository</code> inside the Bundle
<code>elcodi/core-bundle</code>. This bundle is not coupled to any Elcodi functionality so
you can use it in your own projects as a set of isolated features.</p>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s create the Director definition by using the factory pattern.</p>

<p>``` yml
services:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Directors
#
elcodi.director.cart:
    class: Elcodi\Component\Core\Services\ObjectDirector
    arguments:
        - @doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager
        - @cart_repository
        - @cart_factory
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Take in account that each entity will have it&rsquo;s own Director instance, so this
is why we use the factory pattern here.</p>

<p>How can we use the new Director service in our first <code>CartWrapper</code>
implementation by changing and improving the services dependencies? Let&rsquo;s do
that!</p>

<p>``` php
/<em>*
 * CartWrapper
 </em>/
class cartWrapper
{</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @var ObjectDirector
 *
 * Cart director
 */
protected $cartDirector;

/**
 * Construct
 *
 * @param ObjectDirector $cartDirector Cart Director
 */
public function __construct(ObjectDirector $cartDirector)
{
    $this-&gt;cartDirector = $cartDirector;
}

/**
 * Load cart
 *
 * @param UserInterface $user User
 *
 * @return CartInterface
 */
public function loadCart($user)
{
    $userCart = $this
        -&gt;cartDirector
        -&gt;findOneBy([
            'user' =&gt; $user
        ]);

    if (!($userCart instanceof CartInterface)) {

        $newCart = $this
            -&gt;cartDirector
            -&gt;create($user);

        $this
            -&gt;cartDirector
            -&gt;save($newCart);

        $userCart = $newCart;
    }

    return $userCart;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/elcodi/elcodi">Elcodi</a> is fully based on the usage of
Directors. This does <strong>not</strong> mean that we must use Directors everywhere.
Sometimes you need to use only one of the wrapped objects, and in that case you
must inject them one by one, so please, before using this new object think about
it, think about the pros and the contras and be responsible about your
implementation.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to comment about what do you think about this feature.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

    <id>http://elcodi-blog.github.io/blog/2015/04/04/first-stable-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there everyone.</p>

<p>The Elcodi core team is glad to announce that next June 1st, we will tag the
first stable release of the project (Elcodi will be still based on Symfony, you
know how much we like Symfony and its community&hellip;)</p>

<h3>Elcodi v1.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>Until this day, we&rsquo;ll finish stabilization of all packages</li>
<li>We will work so hard to finish a documentation for all of you</li>
<li>All available features will be covered by unit, functional and behavioral
tests, using PHPUnit and Behat 3.0</li>
<li>After <code>v1.0</code> we will start working on <code>v3.0</code>. This new version will be
released next November in order to be compatible with Symfony <code>v3.*</code>. It means
as well that this new version will introduce some BC Break, of course.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, we have less than 2 months to stabilize Elcodi package, and we need your
help.</p>

<p>Some days ago, we announced the
<a href="http://blog.elcodi.io/blog/2015/03/03/elcodi-bug-hunting/">Elcodi Bug Hunting</a>,
remember? Well, initially this contest was during this past March, but we have
decided to enlarge the period of the contest until June 1st, the day of the
release.</p>

<p>Until now, we have received some help from some people. Special thanks for them.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Acordoval">cordoval</a></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an official statement from Elcodi Team.</p>

<blockquote><p>This post was an April Fools joke. Elcodi will be based on Symfony for a long
time. We love Symfony.</p></blockquote>

<p>After some nice months using Symfony in our project Elcodi, and after many
reflections on how to increase the project quality, we&rsquo;re proud to announce that
we are moving to Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Until version <code>v0.6.*</code> we will continue evolving our code for these people who
is nowadays using Elcodi in their projects, but after that, we will move all
our code to Ruby.</p>
