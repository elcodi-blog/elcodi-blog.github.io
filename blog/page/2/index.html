  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a complement to the <a href="http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/08/07/symfony-walk-zaragoza-madrid/">#SymfonyWalk</a> we start <a href="/blog/categories/one-section-one-component/">&ldquo;One section, one component&rdquo;</a>, a series of posts about some of the symfony components. Let&rsquo;s start with routing!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>As each component does, the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/Routing">Routing component</a> focuses and solves a small problem, in this case, matching urls to routes, so we can extract related information, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Things you can do with this component:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load your routes from anywhere into a collection.</li>
<li>Check if a request matches any of the routes.</li>
<li>Extract route-specific info from the request.</li>
<li>Generate a url from a route and route specific info.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Basic classes</h2>

<p>The cast of this component is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>Route</code></strong>: definition of a route, with path, requirements, options and conditionsâ€¦</li>
<li><strong><code>RouteCollection</code></strong>: this bundles one or more <code>Routes</code> and allows to configure all of them at once.</li>
<li><strong><code>Matcher</code></strong>: Searches a <code>RouteCollection</code> for a matching uri.</li>
<li><strong><code>RequestContext</code></strong>: Context from the current request.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Example of usage</h2>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Other classes</h2>

<p>Other supporting actors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loader</strong>: Loads a <code>RouteCollection</code> from a source.</li>
<li><strong>Generator</strong>: The opposite of <code>Matcher</code>, given a route name and route-specific information, generates the uri.</li>
<li><strong>Dumper</strong>: The opposite of <code>Loader</code>, dumps a <code>RouteCollection</code> in different formats.</li>
<li><strong>Router</strong>: basically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">facade</a> to <code>Matcher</code> and <code>Generator</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Symfony2 framework</h2>

<p>Symfony2 framework reads routes from routing files with this component, matches the current <code>Request</code> and chooses which <code>Controller</code> and action to run. It also extends the <code>Router</code> so you can use parameter placeholders from <a href="https://github.com/symfony/DependencyInjection"><code>DependencyInjection</code></a> and integrates with the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/Config"><code>Config</code></a> component to allow caching.</p>

<h2>In Elcodi</h2>

<p>In Elcodi, as a library, we try not to couple our very few controllers to a specific route and we leave that responsibility to the layers above. For more complex scenarios, like the <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/MediaBundle"><code>MediaBundle</code></a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/tree/ec8fabe99489ae9dd1ef671eefaaa7ac89e24cdb/src/Elcodi/Bundle/PageBundle"><code>PageBundle</code></a>, we implement our own custom <code>Loader</code> so we can route through them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This component deals with the next step just after getting your <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation">HTTP Request</a> and gives you great power and flexibility to split your application into several routes.</p>

<p>I hope you find this component useful!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This last week we were working hard on our next milestone: our presentation at the <a href="http://madrid2014.symfony.com">#SymfonyCon</a> on November 27th. <a href="https://github.com/mmoreram">@mmoreram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alch">@alch</a> will speak about how we&rsquo;re building a flexible e-commerce library on top of best practices. We&rsquo;ll dig into the guts of <a href="http://elcodi.io">Elcodi</a> and talk about the tecnologies we&rsquo;ve been using to decouple and allow our users to customize everything to suit their business needs.</p>

<p>Also, @mmoream started walking this Sunday what he calls the <a href="http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/08/07/symfony-walk-zaragoza-madrid">#SymfonyWalk</a>, a road-trip between Zaragoza and Madrid that will last for 10 days. All this on foot! We wish Marc good health and good luck in that journey!</p>

<p>In the more technical side, we&rsquo;ve been integrating <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/tree/feature/page-component">our soon-to-be-released Elcodi&rsquo;s <code>PageBundle</code></a> into <code>bamboo-admin</code>, so you can add content pages to your stores. This will appear in the next release for sure, soâ€¦ stay tuned!</p>

<p>Also, our <a href="https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/pull/677">PR for PayPal authentication</a> finally made it into HWI/OAuthBundle. Nice!</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;ve been putting efforts into making better issues and PRs and closing older ones for a better GitHub experience for our contributors and users.</p>

<p>The PayPal web checkout has been reintegrated into the <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/pull/56">bamboo store</a> meaning that the frontend store is able to receive real payments, other than integrating a <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/pull/56">dummy payment module</a> for testing purposes. Next step is to integrate <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite/StripeBundle">stripe</a> or <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite/PaymillBundle">paymill</a>, which are much more developer-friendly. Stay tuned with the <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite">PaymentSuite</a> updates to see what&rsquo;s coming from there too!</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/pull/677">new PR in HWI/OAuth</a> from our team to add PayPal login support.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve done our first hackaton. We met with some friends to talk about the project, about our implementations and about how to approach the development of our Page Component. It has definitely been the first of many more events like this.</p>

<p>And finally, as you may know, Elcodi will speak at the <a href="http://madrid2014.symfony.com/">SymfonyCon</a> at the end of November. We will talk about some cool things we&rsquo;ve been working on during last months and since we want to celebrate this, part of the team will be walking the <em>330km route</em> between Zaragoza and Madrid. You can read more about this adventure in these posts:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is time to be more vocal about what we are doing and share with the community how we are moving forward along our roadmap and the progress we are making.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://symfony.com/blog/category/a-week-of-symfony">famous symfony weekly bulletin</a>, we would like to do something similar: <em>A week of Elcodi</em>, a series of post assembled in turn by each member of the team.</p>

<p>This week we&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/issues/44">social connectivity for our bamboo store</a>, allowing our users to log in from a variety of OAuth services through integration of <a href="https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle">HWI/OAuthBundle</a> in our project.
A thin layer and a new entity <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/blob/2134302656ae13768ab8e82e54053d01f105d861/src/Elcodi/StoreConnectBundle/Entity/Authorization.php#L31"><code>Authorization</code></a> stores and retrieves links between our <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/blob/master/src/Elcodi/Component/User/Entity/Interfaces/CustomerInterface.php"><code>CustomerInterface</code></a> and the OAuth token. And voilÃ ! You can login with your GitHub account in two clicks!</p>

<p>Sticking with our bamboo store, we prepared a feature branch with PayPal <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/web/web-checkout/">web checkout</a> integration. It has been developed on top of the <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite">PaymentSuite</a> project. You can check out the changes <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/compare/features/paypal-payment?expand=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>We have also been working on a <em>Finite-state machine</em>. Until now we were managing <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/blob/master/src/Elcodi/Component/Cart/Entity/Order.php#L38"><code>Order</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/blob/master/src/Elcodi/Component/Cart/Entity/OrderLine.php#L34"><code>OrderLine</code></a> state changes using an <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/blob/master/src/Elcodi/Component/Cart/Services/OrderStateManager.php#L28">hardwired implementation</a> which was very specific to the <code>Cart</code> component, while any logic implementing a FSM should be reusable. While waiting for Symfony to implement its own state machine in the near futire, we wrote a very simple and useful component that can be used in any project. You can check and review the <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/354">pull request</a></p>

<p>In terms of specific e-commerce features, we just merged some improvements to the Shipping component and Bundle. See the <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/309">Pull Request</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might say that we&rsquo;ve evolved.</p>

<p>An evolution ought to be seen as a positive thing, and ours is no exception.
At first, we had serious doubts about the nature of our project. One of the
questions we kept asking ourselves was what factors should we consider in
choosing whether and when to engage external projects or libraries, and we
believe we made the right decision. In fact, that decision brought us forward in
a big way toward defining ourselves.</p>

<p>Flexible e-commerce components for Symfony2</p>

<p>Anyway, this phrase is actually very ambiguous, as we could be referring to
Symfony as a set of PHP components or as the Framework (I&rsquo;ve always wondered
why they have the same name&hellip; it causes a lot of confusion).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we wanted to reflect a bit, starting from the code itself. Do we want
to use the Symfony Framework or the Symfony Components? The answer seemed to
emerge spontaneously. We want to work with the Symfony components, but we also
want to propose bundles that use the framework.</p>

<p>This was the origin of this commit.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239">https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pull/239</a></p>

<p>We have only just planted the seed with this refactoring. We have realized, even
more, the importance of having both functional testing and unit testing (unit
tests are almost all for the components, while functional tests are for the
bundles). This needs more work, but at least we have lifted this project to a
level at which we truly feel comfortable. It&rsquo;s an excellent starting point for
a long and exciting path ahead.</p>

<p>This change has resulted in some collateral damage, as it has changed the path
of our bundles, meaning that the &ldquo;subtree split&rdquo; has resulted in totally new
repositories beginning with the first commit after refactoring. This means that
all tags prior to version 0.3.0 have been lost, so we apologize to those who
have started to tinkle with our new bundles. You&rsquo;ll now need to adapt to version
~0.3 and check that everything&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>We are available for any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

<p>Such an ambitious venture needs a committed and visionary crew, and obviously more <em>heads</em> and <em>hands</em>. This is why we are opening job positions for a couple of skilled software artisans willing to join the journey with us. We will soon post the complete description. The company is located in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>We are looking for passionate and inspired artisans that love to craft products to be used by fellow developers and that believe in the potential of a community that grows around an <em>opensource</em> project.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>The final word is a big <strong>thank you</strong> to all the people that have been supporting us &ndash; by contributing in different forms &ndash; and to whom will do it someday.</p>

<p>We really seek to build something useful for the community and to receive the necessary feedback and support in order to speed up the development and deliver the sound, reliable, flexible product that we have in mind.</p>

<p>As for now, the Elcodi team hopes that you&rsquo;ll get involved with the project and wishes you a great summer break.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>In the folowing weeks we would like to get to a first community stable version. Though last week we placed the initial milestone it is important to define a release plan for the following steps.</p>

<p>We set up a list of <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/milestones">milestones</a> to show a proposed roadmap:</p>

<p>This means we will be working on fine-tune our general roadmap and on fixing and refining what we have &ndash; no new features will be developed until we improve stability &ndash; in the hope of clearing things up a bit for developers interested in working with Elcodi foundations.</p>

<p>At this stage, it is possible for new commits to introduce <em>BC breaks</em>. There is an open <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/issues/34">issue</a> regarding <code>@api</code> tagging in phpdoc but as suggests in the discussion it is not really needed in the absence of a frozen stable release.</p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t be following strict <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> until we reach a stable release, though we are using <em>patch version</em> for small fixes that do not cause incompatibilities and <em>minor version</em> for changes that <em>could</em> cause BC.</p>

<p>Of course this will change once we approach <code>v1.0</code>, when we will <code>@api</code> freeze core components and enforce full semantic versioning.</p>

<p>Reaching the <code>stable</code> version also means we will release the <em>Market</em>, so that plugins and components can be developed with no fears of major version breaks.</p>

<p>We are on our way there, things look good!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is the second part of a <a href="/blog/2014/08/11/a-short-break-for-meditation/">previous post</a></h5>

<p>We can proudly state we have a lot to do in the following months.</p>

<p>Question is, what now? Maybe we are 1% done along our path, although &ldquo;done&rdquo; in our world sounds a bit odd since there is always room for improvement.
As long as our issue tracker list gets fed, we will stay hungry for enhancing our code.</p>

<h3>GeoBundle</h3>

<p>One of the most recurring challenges in e-commerce development is the modeling of geographic and administrative divisions. We will put our efforts in designing a simple yet extensible set of entities and relations as well as strategies to implement custom tree structures.</p>

<h3>Rule management</h3>

<p>Rule-based decision logic is ubiquitous in e-commerce applications. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which discount coupon can be automatically applied upon entering the checkout process?</li>
<li>Can a particular discount code be applied?</li>
<li>Can two specific products be added to the same cart?</li>
<li>Can a specific product combination trigger a discount, an up-sell or a different offer?</li>
<li>When is it possible to use a specific carrier or payment method?</li>
</ul>


<p>Elcodi <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/rulebundle">RuleBundle</a> aims at solving these kinds of issue.</p>

<h3>Ports and Adapters</h3>

<p>We surely want to promote high-cohesion, loose-coupled software components. Right now we are halfway, as described in the <a href="/blog/2014/08/11/a-short-break-for-meditation/">previous post</a>, but we want to keep improving. A typical usage of P&amp;A would be to decouple Symfony bundles from other significant objects in the domain, or to be able to use Elcodi Cart component without depending on the CustomerBundle.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

<p>A great deal of credibility for an open source project is earned by instilling a thorough and sound test methodology. We assume that we&rsquo;ve been lacking on this specific subject, doing our homeworks halfway. This will be addressed both for Elcodi core repository and web applications (<a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store">BambooStore</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-admin">BambooAdmin</a>) by raising the coverage of unit and functional tests and start working with acceptance tests for the web apps.</p>

<p>We have not decided yet which toolset we will be using, surely one between <a href="http://docs.behat.org/">Behat3</a> and <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">PHPSpec2</a>. As always, suggestions are more than welcome!</p>

<h3>PaymentSuite</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/PaymentSuite">PaymentSuite</a> was conceived and grown inside Elcodi.</p>

<p>It is a payment processing suite developed in Symfony2 which follows our vision of extensibility using adapters and dispatched events to give maximum flexibility to implementers and to decouple specific <code>Cart</code> or <code>Order</code> implementations. It promotes easy and sensible defaults for configurations.</p>

<p>We will take care of the project and will evolve it as the default payment platform. The <a href="http://bamboo.elcodi.com">BambooStore</a> is already using a dummy <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite/FreePaymentBundle">free payment</a> method.</p>

<h3>ShippingSuite</h3>

<p>We would like to follow a similar path as the PaymentSuite: a separated and parallel project that does not depend on Elcodi and that can be easy integrated in web applications. Same vision, same resilience philosophy: work with <code>Order</code> or <code>Carrier</code> as <em>adaptees</em>.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Akin to the phisolophers&#8217; stone, sibling of the Holy Grail, the documentation is the most precious gemstone that an open source project should strive to shape. As Symfony2 author <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot">@fabpot</a> once said, it is the most challenging part of any project.</p>

<p>We are working on the foundation of an <a href="http://elcodi.readthedocs.org">english documentation</a>, localized and translated version will follow later on. This is a list of topics that we will elaborate further:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementation guidelines. General vision and coding philosophy, style and everything needed for developers wishing to contribute.</li>
<li>Customizations. Craft a project using only Elcodi core. Architectural constraints to keep in mind. Recipes and examples.</li>
<li>Core bundles documentation, including

<ul>
<li>Provisioned Model</li>
<li>Event system rationale and taxonomies</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Controllers and extensions, where it may apply</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store">Bamboo</a> <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-admin">web applications</a> documentation for Symfony and front-end developers: the starting point to develop your e-commerce site.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is going to be an epic effort and the real main entrance to the project for the community. No matter the size of your codebase is, documentation is a key measure of a project success.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>If documentation should be our <em>diamond</em>, the community should be our <em>propellant</em>. A good community makes a project good.</p>

<p>We started as a small project and we know how demanding it can be to get involved and contribute to the development of an open source based product.</p>

<p>We will take special care of this particular topic, since motivating people and get them involved is essential for our vision: Elcodi was never mean to be a mere code repository, it is a group of visionary people with a clear view in their minds, working together to work out a specific problem.</p>

<p>Taking care of the code means caring for the people that make it possible for the code to be crafted. We are especially interested in helping those who want to learn, so we will soon arrange training and learning mechanisms, both for Symfony and Elcodi.</p>

<p>Get ready to be effective!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>Puedes encontrar la versiÃ³n en castellano de este post <a href="/blog/2014/08/04/un-momento-para-reflexionar/">aqui</a>.</h5>

<p>Some of you already know Elcodi, a suite of components built on Symfony2 and Doctrine, aiming to provide maximum flexibility and soundness to e-commerce projects.</p>

<p>We believe that coding should always be entertaining and fun.</p>

<p>This has been our main mission since the beginning and as every ambitious goal you cannot forget that along the journey you might discover an equally important path.</p>

<p>I think that we reached the point where it is important to take a breath, so that in the following days we will publish some posts regarding our views and what we&rsquo;ve been learning, where we will talk about what we have developed so far, our expectations and how we would like to drive the development of each part of the project in the following months.</p>

<h1>The path so far</h1>

<p>Elcodi was born a few months ago in a nice workplace located in Barcelona, Spain. We started designing the platform at the beginning of the year, developed and refactored the pieces up the present day where in my opinion we reached a fairly good balanced point, which is the growing seed of our natural direction.</p>

<h3>ProductBundle, AttributeBundle</h3>

<p>Those components are the home for everything regarding products, categories, manufacturers. Product attribute and options were added in a separate bundle and are the dimensions for working in the product variants space, which is one of the latest features developed and is a required trait for almost every e-commerce software implementation.</p>

<p>Multi-category is also supported for products.</p>

<h3>UserBundle</h3>

<p>Contains the models and tools necessary for working with front-end customers or back-end administrators. A basic authentication &amp; authorization definition was also added, exploiting Symfony Security component.</p>

<h3>CartBundle</h3>

<p>It handles the purchase process, carts and orders. Undoubtedly one of the core pillars of any e-commerce, it has been designed to be simple to get a grasp of and to be overridden almost completely by custom logic. You can read about its internal in the <a href="http://elcodi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/bundles/CartBundle/index.html">official documentation</a>.
Point-in-time snapshots of order states or cart to order transitions are examples of what is provided in CartBundle core services default implementation.</p>

<h3>GeoBundle</h3>

<p>Basic building block for a complete hierarchical aggregation of administrative entities. Due to lack of time, at the present day only <code>Country</code> is modeled as a mapped class, leaving <code>State</code>, <code>Province</code> or <code>City</code> as text fields.</p>

<h3>MediaBundle</h3>

<p>Allows the storage-agnostic handling of media files, such as images. It also controls image resizing and consolidates HTTP headers for media files.</p>

<p>Other bundles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>BannerBundle</li>
<li>LanguageBundle</li>
<li>CurrencyBundle</li>
<li>MenuBundle</li>
<li>NewsletterBundle</li>
<li>ReferralProgramBundle</li>
<li>RuleBundle</li>
</ul>


<h3>BambooStore</h3>

<p>We developed a prototype of a front-end store, the <a href="http://bamboo.elcodi.com/">Bamboo</a>. It is a showcase of Elcodi core features and uses <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite">PaymentSuite</a> <a href="https://github.com/PaymentSuite/FreePaymentBundle">FreePaymentBundle</a> as payment method.</p>

<h3>BambooAdmin</h3>

<p>Something we just published. An initial release of a <a href="https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-admin">backoffice application</a>, providing basic features yet usable. Likewise Elcodi core and the Bamboo frontend, it will be in constant development. Versions and releases of the three projects will stay synchronized, not to break dependencies.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>We know that unfortunately, at least at this stage, our design choices and implementation cannot satisfy everyone. Trying to do it would require a massive effort and can lead to a loss of focus and direction. We prefer stick with our vision despite the errors we would make.</p>

<p>A question we are frequently asked is why we are coupling with Symfony and Doctrine: this is a trade-off we had to settle for trying to maximize acceptance from both developers and end users by enforcing clean, coherent, structured and documented code.</p>

<p>Right now we don&rsquo;t think it is feasable to assemble more layers of indirection to achieve this decoupling. The goal is to involve the Symfony community and work on the feedbacks we will receive from developers who want to build applications with Elcodi. Mind you that Symfony decoupling <em>is</em> possible, since we are trying to follow the <strong>SOLID</strong> path, but the eternal struggle between being different and effective flows to a point of balance that surely will benefit both the project and our users.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
