Last few days were kind of crazy at Elcodi, with @alch [leaving the slides ready for our speak at the #SymfonyCon](http://madrid2014.symfony.com/speakers#session-1399), @mmoreram [walking the #SymfonyWalk](http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/11/25/symfony-walk-ends) and @xphere [annoying in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi) and [writing about Symfony Components](http://blog.elcodi.io/blog/categories/one-section-one-component).

But this madness is great, trust me! We'll reach a milestone in our path with the forthcoming #SymfonyCon, and we're proud and happy to have the opportunity to be there, to explain our point of view, the approach we're giving to Elcodi.

Remember, you can keep in touch with us in our [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi) and our [twitter account](https://twitter.com/elcodi_dev). Also we'd be more than happy with more issues, PRs and collaborators in [GitHub](https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi)â€¦ Let's make something funny and useful together!

See you in Madrid! ;-)
