This is an official statement from Elcodi Team.

After some nice months using Symfony in our project Elcodi, and after many
reflections on how to increase the project quality, we're proud to announce that
we are moving to Ruby on Rails.

Until version `v0.6.*` we will continue evolving our code for these people who 
is nowadays using Elcodi in their projects, but after that, we will move all 
our code to Ruby.
