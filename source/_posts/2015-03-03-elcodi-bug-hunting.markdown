Hi everyone!

It's been a long time since our last meeting! We've been very busy here in
Elcodi HQ this months, focusing on the following events. And here we are to tell
you!

## New members

Our team has grown, and we'll be proud to introduce our two new members properly
to you soon. For now, welcome [@tonipinel](//twitter.com/tonipinel) and
[@rogergros](//twitter.com/rogergros)!

## It's beta time!

These last weeks have been awesome here! After a lot of working hours, coffees
and pizzas (and some beers), we're proud and happy to announce we've reached
**beta status in Elcodi** and new version: **v0.5.0**.

This is working. This is really working! Now it's time to test it, massively.

## Elcodi Bug Hunting

In order to make the community participant, we'll arrange something really
amazing: **A contest!**. We have named it *Elcodi Bug Hunting* and will be
available during March 2015.

> Edit: This contest will be opened until June 1st, the day of our first 
> release. It makes sense to increase the contest interval in order to get more
> changes and more competition :)

Let us explain what's this all about!

### The contest

Our goal is to find and fix as many bugs as possible during the beta period, and
to grow more as a community.

### The prices

- Apple Macbook Pro 2014 Retina 13â€
- Apple Ipad Air 16Gb

### Scoring

- Earn points by participating in *Elcodi Bug Hunting*.
- Earn 5 points or more to access the **Macbook Pro** raffle.
- The more points you have, the more chances to win the raffle.
- Get the highest score and win an **Ipad Air**!

#### The easypick

Social interaction is important to us, because that's the way we're reaching and
hearing from you. And we want **you** to be part of this!

## Let's ~~Go~~ PHP!!

Feel free to try the platform, test it and find security vulnerabilities and
bugs. During this month we will improve current features and we will focus on
the quality of the code, with small refactors and more (and more) tests.

We will work as well with the documentation, so feel free to help us on that
task :)

Don't hesitate to get in touch with us and enjoy Elcodi! :)
