Hi there everyone.

The Elcodi core team is glad to announce that next June 1st, we will tag the 
first stable release of the project (Elcodi will be still based on Symfony, you 
know how much we like Symfony and its community...)

### Elcodi v1.0

* Until this day, we'll finish stabilization of all packages
* We will work so hard to finish a documentation for all of you
* All available features will be covered by unit, functional and behavioral 
tests, using PHPUnit and Behat 3.0
* After `v1.0` we will start working on `v3.0`. This new version will be 
released next November in order to be compatible with Symfony `v3.*`. It means 
as well that this new version will introduce some BC Break, of course.

So, we have less than 2 months to stabilize Elcodi package, and we need your 
help.

Some days ago, we announced the 
[Elcodi Bug Hunting](http://blog.elcodi.io/blog/2015/03/03/elcodi-bug-hunting/),
remember? Well, initially this contest was during this past March, but we have 
decided to enlarge the period of the contest until June 1st, the day of the
release.

Until now, we have received some help from some people. Special thanks for them.

* [And many more](https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)

But we need some extra help in order to accomplish our goal.

### Win the MacBookPro

**Apple Macbook Pro 2014 Retina** (of course, with an Android/Ubuntu/Windows 
alternative or any geeky stuff with same price)

* Follow us on twitter (@elcodi_dev)
