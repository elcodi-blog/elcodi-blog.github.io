[Elcodi](http://elcodi.io) is growing so fast.

> Elcodi is an E-commerce platform based on Symfony components. Is composed by
> some PHP Components, by some Symfony Bundles and by a Full-stack project based
> on the Symfony Framework. A all-in-one E-commerce solution, splitted in
> several isolated parts.

We started this project two and a half years ago, and our community is getting 
bigger day after day. That's great because the project grows as well as long as
more people start using it (more needs, more ideas, more contributions, more
fun).

We will start doing monthly meetings online in our
[Gitter channel](http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi). Right now, some people is
daily contributing to Elcodi and having some nice and constructive talks, but we
want to make it even bigger.

Our first monthly meeting will be next November 25th at 6:00pm GMT+1.
This meeting will be hosted by the core team of the project,
[Marc Morera](https://github.com/mmoreram) and
[Emanuele Minotto](https://github.com/EmanueleMinotto).

## Agenda

This meeting will be focused on creating some working groups for the next weeks.
Depending on the people attending at the meeting, we will create more or less
groups, focused on some parts of the application.

These are the points we will talk about.

* Tasks for next version `v1.1`.
* Documentation update and revision.
* Test coverage for `v1.1`.
* Community action. How to make as many people as possible involved.

## Attendees

Maybe you're asking yourself if this meeting is for you.

Well, it depends on your interests. If your job is all about E-commerce, even if
your Symfony skills are no so good, then you should join us. You will have the
opportunity to share some time with really skilled people and to know the way we
have created this project.

If your interest is open source, join us as well. Elcodi is a young project,
focused on finding the right equilibrium between pragmatism and clean
architecture. We use Event-Driven Architecture and annotations at the same time.
Do you want to know why? What are our thoughts? Ask us :)

In other words, if you want to have a nice time with some really good people,
then you definitely should join us and say a big Hello!

Remember, next November 25th at...

* Mexico City, La Havana - 11:00am
* London - 05:00pm
* Barcelona, Paris, Warsaw - 06:00pm
* Moscow - 08:00pm

Looking forward to see you all there!
