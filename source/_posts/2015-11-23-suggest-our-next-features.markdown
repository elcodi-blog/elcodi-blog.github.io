For sure some of you already know about 
[Elcodi's first online meetup](http://blog.elcodi.io/blog/2015/11/20/elcodi-online-meetup/).
It will be next November 25th at 6:00pm GMT+1, and for joining us, you only have
to enter [our gitter room](http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi), say hello, and join
our discussion about Elcodi, Symfony and E-commerce.

One of the topics we'll talk about will be our roadmap. We've configured it just
by thinking what features would be nice to have in the ~~future~~ present, but
Elcodi is a community-first project, so we would love to bring you some voice,
at least to help us deciding about what features we should put our effort the
next months.

> Of course, your voice is the most wanted voice in Elcodi. Make sure you really
> say what you think, so we can improve day by day.

For that, from today until the start of the meeting, you will be able to join 
our room and show us your proposals. This wednesday we will vote each one, and 
the most voted will be part of our `v1.3` roadmap, creating a group of
volunteers for that development.
