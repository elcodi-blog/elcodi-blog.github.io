This last week we were working hard on our next milestone: our presentation at the [#SymfonyCon](http://madrid2014.symfony.com) on November 27th. [@mmoreram](https://github.com/mmoreram) and [@alch](https://github.com/alch) will speak about how we're building a flexible e-commerce library on top of best practices. We'll dig into the guts of [Elcodi](http://elcodi.io) and talk about the tecnologies we've been using to decouple and allow our users to customize everything to suit their business needs.

Also, @mmoream started walking this Sunday what he calls the [#SymfonyWalk](http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/08/07/symfony-walk-zaragoza-madrid), a road-trip between Zaragoza and Madrid that will last for 10 days. All this on foot! We wish Marc good health and good luck in that journey!

In the more technical side, we've been integrating [our soon-to-be-released Elcodi's `PageBundle`](https://github.com/elcodi/elcodi/tree/feature/page-component) into `bamboo-admin`, so you can add content pages to your stores. This will appear in the next release for sure, soâ€¦ stay tuned!

Also, our [PR for PayPal authentication](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/pull/677) finally made it into HWI/OAuthBundle. Nice!

Have fun!
