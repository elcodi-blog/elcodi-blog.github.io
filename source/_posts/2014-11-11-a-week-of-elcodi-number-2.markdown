We've been putting efforts into making better issues and PRs and closing older ones for a better GitHub experience for our contributors and users.

The PayPal web checkout has been reintegrated into the [bamboo store](https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/pull/56) meaning that the frontend store is able to receive real payments, other than integrating a [dummy payment module](https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo-store/pull/56) for testing purposes. Next step is to integrate [stripe](https://github.com/PaymentSuite/StripeBundle) or [paymill](https://github.com/PaymentSuite/PaymillBundle), which are much more developer-friendly. Stay tuned with the [PaymentSuite](https://github.com/PaymentSuite) updates to see what's coming from there too!

Also, there's a [new PR in HWI/OAuth](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/pull/677) from our team to add PayPal login support.

We've done our first hackaton. We met with some friends to talk about the project, about our implementations and about how to approach the development of our Page Component. It has definitely been the first of many more events like this.

And finally, as you may know, Elcodi will speak at the [SymfonyCon](http://madrid2014.symfony.com/) at the end of November. We will talk about some cool things we've been working on during last months and since we want to celebrate this, part of the team will be walking the *330km route* between Zaragoza and Madrid. You can read more about this adventure in these posts:
