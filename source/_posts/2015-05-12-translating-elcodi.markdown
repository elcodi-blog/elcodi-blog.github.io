Hi everyone.

This is a call to the multi language fairy. Our project is still learning some
new and nice languages. Bamboo talks English, Spanish, Catalan and some French, 
but we want to be a project for everyone in this world, no matter where you 
live, no matter what you talk.

We are looking for some contributors to maintain some other interesting 
translations. Indeed, all of them!

* Euskal
* Galego
* Deutsch
* Italiano
* Português
* Nederlands
* ...

We are looking for smaller translations, for those shops that want to provide
specific and local languages.

* Irish
* Andalúz
* Sardu
* Esperanto
* ...

Finally we are looking for some popular and fictitious languages. We want to be
for everyone, remember?

* Klingon
* Elvish
* Dwarf language
* Lorem Ipsum
* Random language
* ...

If you have any interest in translate the application here, please tell us 
something nice [here](https://github.com/elcodi/bamboo/issues/450) or keep in 
touch with us at [gitter](http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi).

Enjoy your week :)
