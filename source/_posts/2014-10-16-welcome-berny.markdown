Today a new friend has join the team, meet Berny Cantos! 

Berny is a seasoned web developer and of course a Symfony lover. He is one of those great old-school coders that forged 
their stamina the *hard way*, out of C/C++ development, before diving into the LAMP world.

He will be helping step up our commitment with the open source community and harden the foundations of our codebase.
